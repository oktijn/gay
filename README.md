### GitArt
This program allows you to paint images in your contributions chart.

Modify the image to be anything you like, Start is where the program is gonna start drawing. It will go from top to bottom.
The box right below it will be the next one to be drawn.
Make sure the width of the image is the amount of boxes in between the start and finish on the x axis, the height will always be 7.

In order for the program to work you require a github repo for the contributions to be happened in. You also need to be logged into github for this to work.

You can make a login at the Credential Manager on windows, click on Windows Credentials. Enter https://github.com in the Internet or network address box. 
The rest is pretty self explanatory.
